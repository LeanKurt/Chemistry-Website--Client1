              </div>
              <div class="topic-description">
                <p>The atomic number (represented by the letter Z) of an element is the number 
                    of protons in the nucleus of each atom of that element. An atom can be 
                    classified as a particular element based solely on its atomic number. For 
                    example, any atom with an atomic number of 8 (its nucleus contains 8 protons) 
                    is an oxygen atom, and any atom with a different number of protons would be a 
                    different element.
                     </p>
                <p>Since atoms are neutral, the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the 
                    number of protons. Hydrogen atoms all have one electron occupying the space 
                    outside of the nucleus. Helium, with two protons, will have two electrons.</p>

          <h1>Mass Number</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>An element’s mass number (A) is the sum of the number of protons and the 
                number of neutrons. Knowing the mass number and the atomic number of an 
                atom allows you to determine the number of neutrons present in that atom by 
                subtraction. </p>
            <p><b>Number of neutrons = Mass number – Atomic number</b></p>
            <p>The composition of any atom can be illustrated with a shorthand notation 
                called A/Z format. Both the atomic number and mass are written to the left of 
                the chemical symbol. The "A" value is written as a superscript while the "Z" 
                value is written as a subscript.</p>

            <p>These numbers of protons or neutrons make complete shells in the nucleus. 
                These are similar in concept to the stable electron shells observed for the noble 
                gases. Nuclei that have magic numbers of both protons and neutrons called "double magic"

          <h1>The Ionizing and Penetration Power of Radiation</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>The constraint on the energy transformation is that total energy must be 
                conserved.</p>
            <p>The ability of radiation to damage molecules is analyzed in terms of what is 
                called ionizing power. When a radiation particle interacts with atoms, the 
                interaction can cause the atom to lose electrons and thus become ionized. The 
                greater the likelihood that damage will occur by an interaction is the ionizing 
                power of the radiation. Ionizing radiation could affect either the whole body 
                (somatic damage) and/or eggs and sperm (genetic damage).</p>
             <p>Much of the threat from radiation is involved with the ease or difficulty of 
                protecting oneself from the particles or the gamma ray. The ability of each type 
                of radiation to pass through matter is expressed in terms of penetration 
                power. The more material the radiation can pass through, the greater the 
                penetration power and the more dangerous they are. In general, the greater 
                mass present, the greater the ionizing power and the lower the penetration 
                power.</p>
           
             <p class="content">Alpha Particles </p>
             <p>The system and surroundings are separated by a “boundary” can either
                insulate or allow heat flow</p>
             <p>Alpha particles have the greatest mass, approximately four times the mass of a 
                proton or neutron and approximately ~8,000 times the mass of a beta particle. 
                Because of the large mass of the alpha particle, it has the highest ionizing 
                power and the greatest ability to damage tissue. That same large size of alpha 
                particles, however, makes them less able to penetrate matter. They collide with 
                molecules very quickly when striking matter, add two electrons, and become a 
                harmless helium atom. Alpha particles have the least penetration power and 
                can be stopped by a thick sheet of paper or even a layer of clothes. They are 
                also stopped by the outer layer of dead skin on people. This may seem to 
                remove the threat from alpha particles but only from external sources. In a 
                situation like a nuclear explosion or some sort of nuclear accident where 
                radioactive emitters are spread around in the environment, the emitters can be 
                inhaled or taken in with food or water and once the alpha emitter is inside you, 
                you have no protection at all</p>
             <p class="content">Beta Particles</p>
             <p>Beta particles are much smaller than alpha particles, and therefore, they have 
                much less ionizing power (less ability to damage tissue), but their small size 
                gives them much greater penetration power. Most resources say that beta 
                particles can be stopped by a one-quarter inch thick sheet of aluminum. Once 
                again, however, the greatest danger occurs when the beta emitting source gets 
                inside of you.
                </p>
            <p class="content">Gamma Particles</p>
            <p>Gamma rays are not particles but a high energy form of electromagnetic 
                radiation (like x-rays except more powerful). Gamma rays are energy that has 
                no mass or charge. Gamma rays have tremendous penetration power and 
                require several inches of dense material (like lead) to shield them. Gamma rays 
                may pass all the way through a human body without striking anything. They 
                are considered to have the least ionizing power and the greatest penetration 
                power.</p>       
            <p>he safest amount of radiation to the human body is zero. It is not possible to 
                be not exposed to ionizing radiation so the next best goal is to be exposed to as 
                little as possible. The two best ways to minimize exposure is to limit time of 
                exposure and to increase distance from the source.</p>
