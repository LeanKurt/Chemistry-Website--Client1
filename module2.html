      <div class="topic-description">
        <p>Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in a substance or an object. The 
            basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be 
            measured in grams (g).</p>
        <p>To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the laboratories, mass may be 
            measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance</p>

          <h1>Measurement of Volume</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>Volume is a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an object takes
                up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m3), but smaller volumes 
                may be measured in cm3, and liquids may be measured in liters (L) or 
                milliliters (mL).</p>            
            <p>Volumes are measured depending on its state:</p>
            <p>The volume of a liquid is measured with a measuring container, such as 
                a measuring cup or graduated cylinder.</p>
            <p>The volume of a gas depends on the volume of its container: gases 
                expand to fill the entire container.</p>
            <p>The volume of a regularly shaped solid can be calculated from its 
                dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the 
                product of its length, width, and height.</p>
            <p>The volume of an irregularly shaped solid can be measured by water 
                displacement method.</p>
            <p class="content">Measuring Volumes of Regular Solids</p>
            <p>The volume of a solid object with a regular geometric shape (rectangular box, 
                cube, cylinder, sphere) can be determined using the volume formula for the 
                shape.</p>
            <p>Cube : 𝑉 = 𝑠^3</p>
            <p>Rectangle : 𝑉 = 𝐿 𝑥 𝑤 𝑥 ℎ
            </p>
            <p>Sphere : 𝑉 = 4/3𝜋𝑟^3</p>
            <p>Cylinder : 𝑉 = 𝜋𝑟^2ℎ
                </p>
            <p>where: V= volume</p>
            <p>s = length of a side</p>
            <p>L = length</p>
            <p>w = width</p>
            <p>h = height </p>
            <p>r = radius</p>
            <p class="content">Measuring Volumes of Irregularly Shaped Solid</p>
            <p>The volumes of irregularly shaped objects cannot be determined using the 
                volume formula. The volume of this objects can be determined using the water 
                displacement method, where the object is submerged in water and the 
                difference in volume before and after the object is submerged will be the 
                volume of the object.</p>
            <p>Procedure: </p>
            <p>1. Place water to a measuring container such as a graduated cylinder and 
                record the volume. This reading will be the initial volume (𝑉𝑖
                )</p>
            <p>2. Submerge the object in the water, as observed, the water level will rise 
                as the object is being submerged. Record the new volume of water. This 
                will be the final reading (𝑉𝑓)</p>
            <p>3. Compute the volume of the object using the formula 𝑉𝑜𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 = 𝑉𝑓 − 𝑉𝑖</p>

           <p>Densities are widely used to identify pure substances and to characterize and
