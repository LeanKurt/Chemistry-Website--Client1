                <h1>Fuels</h1>
              </div>
              <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Fuel is a substance which gives heat energy on combustion. A fuel contains 
                    carbon and hydrogen as main combustible elements. Fuel is any material that 
                    can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or 
                    nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. Heat energy released by reactions 
                    of fuels is converted into mechanical energy via heat engine. </p>
                <p>For example, when we burn paper with a matchstick, light is produced by the 
                    flame. If we analyse this closely, light energy is not created over there, it has just 
                    been produced due to the transformation of heat energy provided by the 
                    matchstick into light energy. Thus, we always need a certain substance to 
                    convert one form of energy into another for accomplishing various jobs. We call 
                    such materials as fuels. In other words, any substance which upon combustion 
                    produces a usable amount of energy is known as fuel. Example: fossil fuels, 
                    biogas, nuclear energy, etc</p>
                <p>To utilize the energy of fuel in most usable form, it is required to transform the 
                    fuel from its one state to another, i.e. from solid to liquid or gaseous state, liquid 
                    to gaseous state, or from its chemical energy to some other form of energy via 
                    single or many stages. In this way, the energy of fuels can be utilized more
                    effectively and efficiently for various purposes.</p>
            
                <p class="content">Properties of an Ideal Fuel</p>
                <p><b>Ignition temperature</b></p>
                 <p>The temperature at which the substance catches fire is known as its ignition 
                    temperature. An ideal fuel must have easily attainable ignition temperature. For 
                    example, the chemical present on the head of the matchstick catches fire easily 
                    using the heat produced by friction generated on rubbing it with side of the 
                    matchbox.</p>
                 <p><b> Calorific value</b></p>
                 <p>The purpose of the fuel is to convert its chemical energy into heat and other 
                    forms of energy on burning. An ideal fuel must have high calorific value to serve 
                    the purpose better</p>
                 <p><b>Impact on the environment</b></p>
                 <p>An ideal fuel must leave less residue (harmful) on burning. It should undergo 
                    complete combustion so as not to add particulate matter in the atmosphere. For 
                    example, compressed natural gas leaves almost no residue on burning.</p>
                 <p><b>Rate of Combustion</b></p>
                 <p>An ideal fuel must burn at constant/moderate rate. Rapid and explosive 
                    combustion are not the characteristic features of an ideal fuel.</p>
                 <p><b>Availability</b></p>
                 <p>An ideal fuel should be easily and ever available. It should be available at low 
                    cost.</p>
                 <p><b>6. Handling  </b></p>
                 <p>Easy storage and transportation prevent the loss of the fuel and also protects the 
                    environment. It improves the accessibility of the fuel</p>

          <h1>Solid Fuels and their Characteristics</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>Solid Fuels - refers to various types of solid material that are used as fuel to 
                produce energy and provide heating, usually released through combustion. Coal 
                is classified into three major types; anthracite, bituminous, and lignite. However, 
                there is no clear demarcation between them. Coal is further classified as semanthracite, semi-bituminous, and sub-bituminous. Anthracite is the oldest coal 
                from a geological perspective. It is a hard coal composed mainly of carbon with 
                little volatile content and practically no moisture. </p>
            <p>The units of heat are therefore the units of energy, or joules (J). </p>
            <p>Heat is transferred by conduction, convection, and/or radiation.</p>

          <h1>Primary and Secondary Fuels</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
           <p>Primary fuels or primary energy sources are dense sources of primary energy 
            found as natural resources. Primary fuels are fuels that are found in nature and 
            can be extracted, captured, cleaned, or graded without any sort of energy 
            conversion or transformation process. This means that all processing and 
            collecting of the fuel is done before the fuel is converted into heat or mechanical 
            work. These primary fuels tend to be non-renewable, and some of the most 
            commonly known primary fuels are fossil fuels. Energy harvested from primary 
            fuels tends to make up most of a country's total primary energy supply or TPES. </p>
           <p>Primary fuels such as coal should be distinguished from primary energy flows 
            like wind and solar power. Although they are all sources of primary energy, 
            primary fuels are "consumed". In contrast, a flow such as wind doesn't get 
            "consumed"â€”rather, it makes more sense to think of flows as being "utilized".</p>
            <p class="content">Types of Primary Fuels</p>
            <p>Most of the primary fuels used currently are non-renewable. However, one 
                major renewable primary fuel is from biomass sources. Other examples of 
                primary fuel are:</p>
            <p>Coal
            </p>
            <p>Crude oil
            </p>
            <p>Bitumen</p>
            <p>Natural gas</p>
            <p>Uranium </p>
            <p> Thorium </p>
            <p>Primary fuels such as these can be obtained from the ground using several 
                different mining techniques. While coal is mined more "traditionally" using strip 
                mines or deep mines, certain sources of natural gas such as shale gas or tight gas 
                are obtained by fracturing large stones with poor permeability. Overall, there 
                are many different ways to obtain these vital resources.</p>  
            <p class="content">Secondary fuel</p>  
            <p>Secondary fuels are fuels that are derived from some primary fuel or fuels 
                through chemical or physical processes. These are fuels that are not found as a 
                natural resource. The energy for these secondary fuels comes initially from 
                primary energy sources.</p> 
            <p>Gasoline is the best example of a secondary fuel, as it must be made from oil 
                through distillation processes. While many of the actual chemicals in gasoline 
                are found in crude oil, they must be separated out in order to put the 
                hydrocarbons in the most useful form.</p> 
            <p>Secondary fuels are often made to maximize the ability for combustion to get 
                energy into an engine. This means that secondary fuels are often an 
                intermediate form of energy between the primary energy and the energy 
                services. This intermediate form is also known as an energy currency but 
                energy currencies also include electricity which not a fuel.</p>

        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>Liquid fuels like furnace oil and are predominantly used in industrial 
                applications. Most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the fossilized 
                remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust. 
                However, there are several types, such as hydrogen fuel (for 
                automotive uses), ethanol, jet fuel and biodiesel which are all categorized as a
