                <h1>Quantum Numbers
                </h1>

              <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Quantum numbers is used describe the distribution of electrons in the atom.</p>
                <p>The three coordinates that come from Schrodinger's wave equations are the 
                    principal (n), angular (l), and magnetic (m) quantum numbers. These quantum 
                    numbers describe the size, shape, and orientation in space of the orbitals on an 
                    atom.</p>
                <p><b>The principal quantum number (n)</b> designates the principal electron shell. 
                    Because n describes the most probable distance of the electrons from the 
                    nucleus, the larger the number n is, the farther the electron is from the nucleus, 
                    the larger the size of the orbital, and the larger the atom is. n can be any positive 
                    integer starting at 1, as n=1 designates the first principal shell (the innermost 
                    shell). The first principal shell is also called the ground state, or lowest energy
                    state. This explains why n cannot be 0 or any negative integer, because there 
                    exist no atoms with zero or a negative amount of energy levels/principal shells</p>
                <p><b>The angular quantum number (l)</b> describes the shape of the orbital. Orbitals 
                    have shapes that are best described as spherical (l = 0), polar (l = 1), or cloverleaf 
                    (l = 2). They can even take on more complex shapes as the value of the angular 
                    quantum number becomes larger.</p>
                <p><b>The magnetic quantum number (ml)</b> determines the number of orbitals and 
                    their orientation within a subshell. Consequently, its value depends on the 
                    orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Given a certain l, ml is an interval 
                    ranging from –l to +l , so it can be zero, a negative integer, or a positive integer. </p>
                <p>ml = -l, (-l + 1), (-l + 2), …, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2,…, (l -1), (l -2), +l</p>

          <h1>Electron Configurations</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>The electron configuration of an atom describes the orbitals occupied by 
                electrons on the atom. One rule governing electron configuration is the Aufbau 
                Principle, which states that each successive electron occupies the lowest energy 
                orbital available.</p>            
            <p>The<b> Aufbau principle</b> dictates the manner in which electrons are filled in the 
                atomic orbitals of an atom in its ground state. It states that electrons are filled 
                into atomic orbitals in the increasing order of orbital energy level. According to 
                the Aufbau principle, the available atomic orbitals with the lowest energy levels 
                are occupied before those with higher energy levels.</p>
            <p>The order of increasing energy of the orbitals is then read off by following these 
                arrows, starting at the top of the first line and then proceeding on to the second, 
                third, fourth lines, and so on. This diagram predicts the following order of 
                increasing energy for atomic orbitals </p>
           <p>The <b>Pauli Exclusion Principle states</b> that, in an atom or molecule, no two 
            electrons can have the same four electronic quantum numbers. As an orbital can 
            contain a maximum of only two electrons, the two electrons must have opposing 
            spins. This means if one is assigned an up-spin (+1/2), the other must be downspin (-1/2 )</p>
            <p><b>Hund's Rule</b> states that:</p>
            <p>Every orbital in a sublevel is singly occupied before any orbital is doubly 
                occupied.</p>
            <p>All of the electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin (to 
                maximize total spin).</p>

        <div class="topic-description">
           <p>For atoms with the largest electronegativity differences (such as metals bonding 
            with nonmetals), the bonding interaction is called ionic, and the valence 
            electrons are typically represented as being transferred from the metal atom to 
            the nonmetal. Once the electrons have been transferred to the non-metal, both 
            the metal and the non-metal are considered to be ions. The two oppositely 
            charged ions attract each other to form an ionic compound. </p>

          <h1>Metals</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>Metals are the most commonly used class of engineering material. Metal alloys 
                are especially common, and they are formed by combining a metal with one or 
                more other metallic and/or non-metallic materials.</p>
            <p>The combination usually occurs through a process of melting, mixing, and 
                cooling. The goal of alloying is to improve the properties of the base material in 
                some desirable way.</p>
                <p>Metal alloy compositions are described in terms of the percentages of the 
                 various elements in the alloy, where the percentages are measured by weight.</p>
             <p class="content">Ferrous metals</p>
             <p>These are metals and alloys containing a high proportion of the element 
                iron.</p>
             <p class="content">Non–ferrous metals</p>    
             <p>These materials refer to the remaining metals known to mankind.
                The pure metals are rarely used as structural materials as they lack mechanical strength.</p> 
             <p>They are mainly used with other metals to improve their strength.</p> 
             <p>They are used where their special properties such as corrosion 
                resistance, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity are 
                required. </p> 
             <p>The non-ferrous metals are usually employed in industry due to the following 
                characteristics:</p> 
             <p>Ease of fabrication (casting, rolling, forging, welding and machining),</p> 
             <p>Resistance to corrosion</p>
             <p> Electrical and thermal conductivity</p>  
             <p>Weight</p>
