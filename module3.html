              <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Energy, in physics, the capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, 
                    thermal, electrical, chemical, nuclear, or other various forms. There are, 
                    moreover, heat and work—i.e., energy in the process of transfer from one body 
                    to another </p>
                <p class="content">Two Major Forms of Energy</p>
                <p><u>Kinetic energy</u> is the energy in moving objects or mass. Examples include 
                    mechanical energy, electrical energy etc</p>
                <p><u>Potential energy</u> is any form of energy that has stored potential that can be put 
                    to future use.</p>
                <p class="content">Forms of Energy</p>
                <p><u>Chemical Energy</u> is the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a 
                    transformation through a chemical reaction to transform other chemical 
                    substances. Examples include batteries, food, gasoline and etc</p>
                <p><u>Thermal energy</u> comes from a substance whose molecules and atoms are 
                    vibrating faster due to a rise in temperature. Heat energy is another name for 
                    thermal energy.</p>
                <p><u>Mechanical Energy</u> is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. It is the 
                    energy associated with the motion and position of an object.</p>
                <p><u>Electrical Energy</u> is caused by moving electric charges called electrons.</p>
                <p>Sound Energy is produced when an object vibrates. The sound vibrations cause 
                    waves of pressure that travel through a medium, such as air, water, wood or 
                    metal.</p>
                <p><u>Light Energy</u> is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the 
                    electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is the 
                    visible spectrum that is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the 
                    sense of sight.</p>
                    <p><u>Nuclear Energy</u> is defined as energy that comes from changes in the nucleus of 
                        an atom.</p>

          <h1>HEAT</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>Is the flow of energy between two objects, from the warmer one to the 
                cooler one, because of a difference in their temperatures.</p>            
            <p>Is a process not a quantity </p>
            <p>The units of heat are therefore the units of energy, or joules (J). </p>
            <p>Heat is transferred by conduction, convection, and/or radiation.</p>
            <p class="content">Heat by Conduction</p>
            <p>Conduction occurs when two objects at different temperatures are in contact 
                with each other. Heat flows from the warmer to the cooler object until they are 
                both at the same temperature. Conduction is the movement of heat through a
                substance by the collision of molecules.</p>
            <p class="content">Heat by Convection</p>
            <p>Convection is heat transfer by mass motion of a fluid such as air or water when 
                the heated fluid is caused to move away from the source of heat, carrying 
                energy with it. Convection above a hot surface occurs because hot air expands, 
                becomes less dense, and rises. Hot water is likewise less dense than cold water 
                and rises, causing convection currents which transport energy. 
                </p>
            <p class="content">Heat by Radiation</p>
            <p>Radiation is a method of heat transfer that does not rely upon any contact 
                between the heat source and the heated object as is the case with conduction 
                and convection. Heat can be transmitted through empty space by thermal 
                radiation often called infrared radiation. This is a type electromagnetic 
                radiation. No mass is exchanged and no medium is required in the process of 
                radiation.</p>

            <p class="content">Pressure-Volume Work: Work done by a gas</p>
            <p>Gases can do work through expansion or compression against a constant 
            external pressure. Work done by gases is also sometimes called PressureVolume or PV work</p>

          <h1>Conservation of Energy</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
            <p>The constraint on the energy transformation is that total energy must be 
                conserved.</p>
            <p>If we account properly for all the energy conversion and energy transfer 
                processes, the total amount of energy present must remain constant.</p>
             <p class="content">Definition of Terms</p>
             <p>A “system” is the part of the universe that is being considered.</p>
             <p>The “surroundings” are everything else in the environment or the remainder 
                of the universe.</p>
             <p class="content">System + Surroundings = Universe</p>
             <p>The system and surroundings are separated by a “boundary” can either
                insulate or allow heat flow</p>
             <p>OPEN SYSTEM: Mass and energy freely moves in and out between the system 
                and the surrounding</p>
             <p>CLOSED SYSTEM: when matter CANNOT cross the boundary </p>
             <p>ISOLATED SYSTEM: No interaction between the system and the surrounding</p>
