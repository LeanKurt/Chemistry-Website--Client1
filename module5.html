            <p>A redox reaction involves a transfer of electrons between two species. </p>
            <p><b>Oxidation</b> occurs when a species loses electrons and increases its oxidation 
                number (O.N.). An equation that shows this loss is called an oxidation halfreaction. 
                In this half-reaction, the electrons are in the product side.</p>
            <p> occurs when a specie gain electron and decreases its oxidation 
                number (O.N.). An equation that shows this gain is called a reduction half
            <p><b>Conduction</b>occurs when two objects at different temperatures are in contact 
                with each other. Heat flows from the warmer to the cooler object until they are 
                both at the same temperature. Conduction is the movement of heat through a
                substance by the collision of molecules.</p>
            <p class="content">Heat by Convection</p>
            <p><b>Convection</b> heat transfer by mass motion of a fluid such as air or water when 
                the heated fluid is caused to move away from the source of heat, carrying 
                energy with it. Convection above a hot surface occurs because hot air expands, 
                becomes less dense, and rises. Hot water is likewise less dense than cold water 
                and rises, causing convection currents which transport energy.

            <p>The ion or molecule that donates the electrons (i.e. oxidized) is called

                <b>oxidizing</b> agent.</p>

            <p>Example 1: Iron-Vanadium Couple</p>
            <p>Given the redox reaction </p>
            <p><b> 𝑭𝒆^𝟑+ + 𝑽^𝟐+ → 𝑭𝒆^𝟐+ + 𝑽^𝟑+</b></p>
            <p>which species is oxidized? Which is reduced? Identify the reducing agent and 
                the oxidizing agent.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b></p>
                <p>𝑭𝒆^𝟑+ is reduced into 𝑭𝒆^𝟐+ and </p>
                <p>𝑽^𝟐+ is oxidized into 𝑽^𝟑+</p>
                <p>This is because the oxidized species loses electrons, and the reduced species 
                    gains electrons.</p>
                <p>Iron gains an electron (𝑭𝒆^𝟑+ → 𝑭𝒆^𝟐+), and vanadium loses an electron (𝑽^𝟐+ → 𝑽^𝟑+).
                    </p>
                <p>Thus, 𝑭𝒆^𝟑+ is the oxidizing agent and 𝑽^𝟐+ is the reducing agent.</p>

          <h1>Batteries: Chemistry and Reactions</h1>  
        </div> 
        <div class="topic-description">
           <p>A battery is an electrochemical cell or series of cells that produces an electric 
            current. It is used in many day-to-day devices such as cellular phones, laptop 
            computers, clocks, and cars. An ideal battery would never run down, produce 
            an unchanging voltage, and be capable of withstanding environmental 
            extremes of heat and humidity. Real batteries strike a balance between ideal 
            characteristics and practical limitations. </p>
           <p>There are two basic types of batteries: primary and secondary</p>
            <p class="content">Primary Batteries</p>
            <p>Primary batteries are single-use batteries because they cannot be recharged. 
                A common primary battery is the dry cell (Figure 3). The dry cell is a zinc carbon battery. The zinc can serve as both a container and the negative 
                electrode. The positive electrode is a rod made of carbon that is surrounded by 
                a paste of manganese (IV) oxide, zinc chloride, ammonium chloride, carbon 
                powder, and a small amount of water. The reaction at the anode can be 
                represented as the ordinary oxidation of zinc.</p>
                <p><b>Alkaline batteries</b> were developed in the 1950s partly to address 
                    some of the performance issues with zinc–carbon dry cells. They are 
                    manufactured to be exact replacements for zinc-carbon dry cells. As their name 
                    suggests, these types of batteries use alkaline electrolytes, often potassium 
                    hydroxide.</p>
                <p class="content">Secondary Batteries</p>
                <p>Secondary batteries are rechargeable. These are the types of batteries found 
                    in devices such as smartphones, electronic tablets, and automobiles.</p>
                <p><b>Nickel-cadmium, or NiCd, batteries</b> consist of a nickel-plated 
                    cathode, cadmium-plated anode, and a potassium hydroxide electrode. The 
                    positive and negative plates, which are prevented from shorting by the 
                    separator, are rolled together and put into the case. This is a “jelly-roll” design 
                    and allows the NiCd cell to deliver much more current than a similar-sized 
                    alkaline battery.</p>
                <p><b>Lithium ion batteries</b> are among the most popular rechargeable 
                    batteries and are used in many portable electronic devices.</p>
                <p><b>Lead Acid Battery</b> is the type of secondary battery used in your 
                    automobile. It is inexpensive and capable of producing the high current 
                    required by automobile starter motors.</p>
                <p class="content">Fuel Cells</p>
                <p><b>A fuel cell</b> is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. Fuel 
                    cells are similar to batteries but require a continuous source of fuel, often 
                    hydrogen. They will continue to produce electricity as long as fuel is available. 
                    Hydrogen fuel cells have been used to supply power for satellites, space 
                    capsules, automobiles, boats, and submarines</p>

            <p>Consider the reaction of metallic zinc with cupric ion (Cu^2+) to give copper 
                metal and Zn^2+ ion. The balanced chemical equation is as follows</p>
            <p>Galvanic or voltaic cells involve spontaneous electrochemical reactions in 
                which the half-reactions are separated  so that current can flow
