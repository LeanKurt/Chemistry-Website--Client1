               <p>By using the definition of internal energy, under constant volume conditions, 
                 the change in internal energy equals the heat flow. </p>
               <p class="content">∆E = q + w</p>
               <p>When gas expands, it does an amount of work equal to P∆V on its 
                 surroundings, but if the expanding gas is our system, we want w to be the work 
                 done on the gas, and that will be - P∆V.</p>
               <p>So. we can replace w in the equation:</p>
               <p class="content">∆E = q - P∆V</p>
               <p>If the volume is held constant, ∆V =0, so the equation becomes</p>
               <p class="content">∆E = qv</p>
               <p>The equation shows how internal energy is related to heat, where the subscript 
                 “v” is added to denote that the equation is correct only under constant volume 
                 conditions.</p>
               <p class="content">H = E + PV</p>
               <p>Enthalpy (H) is used to quantify the heat flow into or out of a system in a 
                 process that occurs at constant pressure.</p>
               <p>From this definition, the change in enthalpy (∆H) will be equal to the heat flow 
                 under constant pressure conditions. The change in enthalpy (∆H) must be</p>
                   <p class="content">∆H = ∆E + ∆(PV)</p>
                   <p>Expand by substituting for ∆E = q - P∆V</p>
                   <p class="content">∆H = (q - P∆V) + ∆(PV)</p>
                   <p>If pressure is held constant, then the ∆(PV) term will simply become P∆V</p>
                   <p class="content">∆H = q - P∆V + P ∆V</p>
                   <p class="content">∆H = q - P∆V + P ∆</p>
                   <p class="content">∆H = qp</p>

           <p>Endothermic – more energy is taken in to break the bonds in the reactants 
            than released by the bonds being formed in the products. Therefore, energy is 
            absorbed</p>
           <p>Reactants + Heat → Products</p>
            <p>Exothermic – More energy is released when the products where formed than 
               energy was used to break bonds in the reactants. Therefore, a net release of 
               energy.</p>
            <p>***A reaction is EXOTHERMIC if more energy is RELEASED than SUPPLIED. If

         <h1>Analysis of a Heating Curve</h1>  
       </div> 
       <div class="topic-description">
           <p>There are five distinct parts to the 
              heating curve</p>            
           <p><b>A→B = solid ice.</b> Solid ice is heated and the temperature increases until 
              the normal freezing/melting point of zero degrees Celsius is reached. 
              The amount of heat added, q, can be computed by 𝒒 = 𝒎𝑪𝑯𝟐𝑶(𝒔𝒐𝒍𝒊𝒅)∆𝑻, 
              where m is the mass of the sample of water, C is the specific heat 
              capacity of solid water, or ice, and ∆𝑇 is the change in temperature 
              during the process. </p>
           <p><b>B→C = Solid starts to change state from solid to liquid.</b> The first 
              phase change is melting; as a substance melts, the temperature stays the 
              same. For water, this occurs at 0 ℃. The above equation (described in 
              part 1 of the curve) cannot be used for this part of the curve because the 
              change in temperature is zero. Instead, use the heat of fusion (ΔHfusion) 
              to calculate how much heat was involved in that process: q=m⋅ΔHfusion, 
              where m is the mass of the sample of water.
               </p>
           <p><b>C→D = temperature starts to rise once all the solid has melted.</b> After 
              all of the solid substance has melted into liquid, the temperature of the 
              liquid begins to increase as heat is absorbed. It is then possible to 
              calculate the heat absorbed by 𝒒 = 𝒎𝑪𝑯𝟐𝑶(𝒍)∆𝑻. Note that the specific 
              heat capacity of liquid water is different than that of ice </p>
           <p><b>D→E = Liquid starts to vaporize, turning from liquid to gas.</b> The 
              liquid will begin to boil when enough heat has been absorbed by the 
              solution that the temperature reaches the boiling point, where again, the 
              temperature remains constant until all of the liquid has become gaseous 
              water. At the atmospheric pressure of 1 atm, this phase transition 
              occurs at 100℃ (the normal boiling point of water). Liquid water 
              becomes water vapor or steam when it enters the gaseous phase. Use 
              the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap ) to calculate how much heat was 
              absorbed in this process: q=m⋅ΔHvap, where m is the mass of the sample 
              of water</p>
           <p><b>E-F = temperature starts to rise once all liquid is vaporized.</b>After all 
              of the liquid has been converted to gas, the temperature will continue to 
              increase as heat as added. Again, the heat added that results in a certain 
              change temperature is given by: 𝒒 = 𝒎𝑪𝑯𝟐𝑶(𝒈𝒂𝒔)∆𝑻 . Note that the 
              specific heat capacity of gaseous water is different than that of ice or 
              liquid water.</p>
           <p>Water has a high boiling point because of the presence of extensive 
              hydrogen bonding interactions between the water molecules in the 
              liquid phase (water is both a strong hydrogen bond donor and 
              acceptor). When heat is first applied to water, it must break the 
              intermolecular hydrogen bonds within the sample. After breaking the 
              bonds, heat is then absorbed and converted to increased kinetic energy 
              of the molecules in order to vaporize them.</p>

          <p>Melting occurs when heat flows into a solid object. The melting point of a 
           crystalline solid is the temperature at which the forces holding the crystal 
           lattice together are broken and it becomes a liquid.
            </p>
          <p>Sublimation is when a solid phase goes directly into a gaseous phase without 
           first becoming a liquid</p>
           <p>Deposition is the process by which a gas or vapor changes directly to a solid, 
              and is the reverse of sublimation.</p>
           <p>Frost is an example of deposition</p>
           <p>Snowflakes are also formed in the upper atmosphere by deposition of ice 
              crystals.</p>
           <p>Freezing, or solidification, is a phase transition in which liquid turns into a 
              solid when its temperature is lowered to or below its freezing point</p>
           <p>Condensation is the process by which a gas or vapor becomes a liquid.</p>
           <p>Condensation is the reverse of evaporation.</p>
           <p>Vaporization is a phase transition from the liquid phase to the gas phase.</p>
           <p>Fusion is when a solid melt to form a liquid</p>
